We want to connect dogs in need with humans in need. 

With your zip code we will connect you with a dog in need, and the items needed to get your home ready for the new family member on day one. This way there will be no surprises, no headaches only memories made. 

With the use of Petfinder and Store APIs we empower users.  

Currently we have user authentication.

In future builds we wish to add a cart feature, which will save animals to review later.
